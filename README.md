# CSV-Validator

Build with maven to obtain the opencsv dependency.
e.g: "mvn package"

Validate a CSV file with the following rules:


* The entire CSV is in the UTF-8 character set.
* The Timestamp column should be formatted in ISO-8601 format.
* The Timestamp column should be assumed to be in US/Pacific time;
  please convert it to US/Eastern.
* All ZIP codes should be formatted as 5 digits. If there are less
  than 5 digits, assume 0 as the prefix.
* All name columns should be converted to uppercase. There will be
  non-English names.
* The Address column should be passed through as is, except for
  Unicode validation. Please note there are commas in the Address
  field; your CSV parsing will need to take that into account. Commas
  will only be present inside a quoted string.
* The columns `FooDuration` and `BarDuration` are in HH:MM:SS.MS
  format (where MS is milliseconds); please convert them to a floating
  point seconds format.
* The column "TotalDuration" is filled with garbage data. For each
  row, please replace the value of TotalDuration with the sum of
  FooDuration and BarDuration.
* The column "Notes" is free form text input by end-users; please do
  not perform any transformations on this column. If there are invalid
  UTF-8 characters, please replace them with the Unicode Replacement
  Character.

If a character is invalid, please replace it with the Unicode Replacement
Character. If that replacement makes data invalid (for example,
because it turns a date field into something unparseable), print a
warning to `stderr` and drop the row from your output.
